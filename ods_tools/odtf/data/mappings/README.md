# MAPPING FILES

The files in this folder are published mapping files, for community use.

If your local folder containing config files and input data files but does not contain mapping files,  the code will search these files for a mapping containing the matching `input_format` and `output_format` contained in your config file. 

These can be copied and edited to create your own versions. We encourage you to share new mappings via this GitHub repo (with update headers to describe the new version and your changes).

For example or demonstration mapping files, please also see https://github.com/OasisLMF/OpenDataTransform/tree/master/examples
